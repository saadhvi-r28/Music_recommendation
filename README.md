A music recommendation system that leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences, listening history, and music characteristics. 

The dataset contains various audio features for each track, such as tempo, loudness, energy, danceability, instrumentalness, and more. These features provide quantitative measures of the characteristics of each song. Also, this dataset explores how user preferences vary across different genres. This could involve analyzing user listening histories or preferences extracted from the Spotify dataset to understand which genres are more popular among certain demographics or in different regions.

The model used for the classification is K-Means Clustering. Instead of directly using individual song features, the system uses clusters generated by K-Means as new features, capturing broader patterns and improving recommendation accuracy.

A web API called Spotipy is used to integrate the ML model with your spotify account. With Spotipy we can get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.

The ML model takes a user's liked song. It iterates through the song to find similar songs from the bigger collection based on available info (artist, year, etc.) and returns a list of 10 songs containing the recommendations.
